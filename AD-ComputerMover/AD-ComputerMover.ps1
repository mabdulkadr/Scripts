.SYNOPSIS
    Flexible script to move computers in AD to matching OUs based on the prefix in the computer name.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script extracts the prefix from the computer name (e.g., "BACKUP" from "BACKUP-01" or "BACKUP2")
    and matches it with OU names using flexible partial matching logic. It ensures that the prefix is at the 
    beginning of the computer name and matches the OU name only if the OU name appears as the prefix, not in the middle.
