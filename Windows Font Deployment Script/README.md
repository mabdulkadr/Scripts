## Overview

This project includes two PowerShell scripts to install and uninstall TrueType (.TTF) and OpenType (.OTF) fonts on Windows systems from a shared network folder.

These scripts are designed for use in enterprise environments where fonts need to be deployed or removed from multiple machines â€” for example, via Microsoft Intune, Group Policy, or SCCM.

## Scripts Included

1. Install-Fonts.ps1
   - Installs all `.ttf` and `.otf` fonts from a shared folder to `CWindowsFonts`.
   - Automatically registers fonts in the system registry.
   - Uses force overwrite and includes color-coded output.

2. Uninstall-Fonts.ps1
   - Uninstalls fonts based on file names in the same shared folder.
   - Removes font files and cleans up associated registry entries.
   - Also includes force execution and color-coded output.
