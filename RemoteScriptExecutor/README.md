## Troubleshooting

Encountering issues? Here are some common problems and their solutions:

### CLI Version

- **WinRM Not Enabled on Remote Machines:**
  - **Solution:** Run the following command on each remote machine to enable PowerShell remoting:
    ```powershell
    Enable-PSRemoting -Force
    ```

- **Firewall Blocking Remoting:**
  - **Solution:** Ensure that the firewall on both local and remote machines allows PowerShell remoting. You can configure this using Group Policy or manually via the firewall settings.

- **Authentication Errors:**
  - **Solution:** Verify that you have administrative privileges on the remote machines and that the credentials used are correct.

- **Script Execution Fails on Remote PCs:**
  - **Solution:** Check the script syntax, ensure all necessary modules are available on remote machines, and review the detailed logs for specific error messages.

- **Exporting Reports Fails:**
  - **Solution:** Ensure you have write permissions to the selected save location and that the filenames are valid.

> **Advanced Troubleshooting:**
>
> - **Enable Verbose Logging:** Modify the script to include verbose output for more detailed logs.
> - **Check Network Connectivity:** Use `Test-Connection` to verify connectivity to remote PCs.
> - **Review Event Logs:** Inspect the Windows Event Viewer on remote machines for related error entries.

### GUI Version
