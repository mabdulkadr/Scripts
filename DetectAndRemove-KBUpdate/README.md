## Overview
This PowerShell script is designed to **detect and remove a specific Windows KB update** from devices. It is particularly useful for managing **compatibility issues** caused by certain updates. The script can be deployed via **Microsoft Intune Remediations** to ensure compliance across all managed devices.

## Features
- **Detection:** Checks if a specific KB update is installed.
- **Remediation:** Uninstalls the update if detected.
- **Silent Execution:** Runs without user intervention.
- **Intune Deployment:** Designed for deployment via Microsoft Intune.

## Scripts Included
1. **Detect-KBUpdate.ps1** - Checks if the KB update is installed.
2. **Remediate-KBUpdate.ps1** - Uninstalls the KB update if found.

## Script Details

### **1. Detect-KBUpdate.ps1**
#### Purpose
Detects whether a specified KB update is installed on a device.

#### How to Run
```powershell
.\Detect-KBUpdate.ps1
```
#### Output
- **Exit Code 0:** KB update **not found** (compliant).
- **Exit Code 1:** KB update **found** (non-compliant, triggers remediation).

### **2. Remediate-KBUpdate.ps1**
#### Purpose
Uninstalls the specified KB update if it is detected.

#### How to Run
```powershell
.\Remediate-KBUpdate.ps1
```
#### Output
- **Uninstalls the KB update silently.**
- **A restart may be required** after removal.

## Important Note
- **You must change the KB number** in both `Detect-KBUpdate.ps1` and `Remediate-KBUpdate.ps1` before deploying to ensure it targets the correct update.
