### 🚀 Performance Optimization
- **Recursive folder scanning** can be slow for large directories. To **improve speed**, consider:
  - **Using Parallel Processing:** Implement `Start-Job` to scan multiple folders simultaneously.
  - **Limiting Scan Depth:** Modify `Get-ChildItem` to exclude deep subdirectories.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting & FAQs

### 🔹 "Script is blocked from running"
**Solution:** Unblock the script:
```powershell
Unblock-File -Path .\DirectorySizeExplorer.ps1
```

### 🔹 "Folder sizes are showing as 0 KB"
**Cause:** Windows **denies access** to system directories for standard users.  
**Solution:** Run PowerShell as Administrator.

### 🔹 "Sorting by size is incorrect"
**Cause:** WPF’s default sorting is **string-based** instead of numeric.  
**Solution:** The script fixes this by using:
```xml
<DataGridTextColumn Header="Size" Binding="{Binding PrettySize}" SortMemberPath="Size" />
```
Ensure all data objects maintain a consistent `Size` type (`[long]`).

### 🔹 "Performance is slow on large directories"
**Solution:**  
- **Exclude unnecessary subdirectories.**
- **Run PowerShell in Administrator mode** for faster access to protected files.
- **Modify `Get-ChildItem` to scan only a limited depth**.
