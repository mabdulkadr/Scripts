
# 🔥 Remote EXE/MSI Uninstaller (WPF GUI)

A **PowerShell-based GUI tool** that allows administrators to **remotely uninstall EXE and MSI applications** from Windows machines. The tool ensures complete cleanup by **removing registry entries, stopping processes, deleting leftover files/folders**, and **cleaning up Start Menu shortcuts and AppData**.

## 🎯 Features

✅ **Remote App Uninstallation**: Lists and removes **EXE/MSI** apps from a remote Windows machine using PowerShell remoting.  
✅ **WPF GUI with Console Output**: Modern interface that logs real-time execution steps in a **console-like text area**.  
✅ **No UI Freezing**: Uses **`Start-Job`** to run uninstall operations asynchronously, keeping the UI responsive.  
✅ **Force Removal of Stubborn Apps**: Converts **MSI `/I` to `/x`**, ensures **silent parameters for EXE**, and **kills running processes** before uninstallation.  
✅ **WinGet Fallback**: If traditional uninstallation fails, it attempts **WinGet uninstall** as a backup method.  
✅ **Full Cleanup**:
   - **Removes leftover registry keys**  
   - **Deletes folders from Program Files (x86) & Program Files**  
   - **Cleans Start Menu shortcuts & folders**  
   - **Searches and deletes app-related files in user `AppData`**  
✅ **CSV Export**: Allows exporting a list of installed applications for auditing.

## 🛠️ **How It Works**
1️⃣ **Retrieves Installed Applications**  
   - Queries registry locations for installed **EXE/MSI** software.  
   - Returns **Application Name, Publisher, Version, Install Date, and Uninstall String**.  
   
2️⃣ **Uninstalls Selected Applications**  
   - **Stops any running processes** matching the app name.  
   - Runs **MSIExec with `/x` and `/quiet` flags** for silent removal.  
   - Ensures **EXE uninstallation is silent** (`/S`, `/quiet`, `/silent`).  

3️⃣ **Cleans Up Leftovers**  
   - **Deletes registry keys** related to the app.  
   - **Removes the app’s installation folder** from **`Program Files`** and **`Program Files (x86)`**.  
   - **Deletes Start Menu shortcuts** that match the app name.  
   - **Searches `AppData` for lingering files** and removes them.

4️⃣ **WinGet Fallback (If Needed)**  
   - If the registry uninstall fails, checks if **WinGet** is installed.  
   - Runs `winget uninstall --name "AppName" --exact --silent`.

## 🗑️ **Cleanup Details**
🔹 **Process Termination**: Stops running processes before attempting uninstall.  
🔹 **Registry Key Removal**: Deletes registry entries under:  
   - `HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall`  
   - `HKLM:\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall`  
🔹 **Program Files Cleanup**: Deletes folders in:  
   - `C:\Program Files\AppName`  
   - `C:\Program Files (x86)\AppName`  
🔹 **Start Menu Cleanup**: Only removes **subfolders and shortcuts that match the app name**, rather than the entire “Programs” directory.  
🔹 **User AppData Cleanup**: Searches and removes `.exe`, `.lnk`, and leftover directories in:
   - `C:\Users\*\AppData\Roaming`
   - `C:\Users\*\AppData\Local`
   - `C:\Users\*\AppData\LocalLow`

## 🔍 **Known Issues & Troubleshooting**
**Q: The script fails to uninstall some apps. Why?**  
✔️ Some software doesn’t register an **UninstallString** in the registry. **WinGet** is required as a fallback.  

**Q: The app is removed, but its Start Menu shortcut remains.**  
✔️ Ensure the **AppData cleanup logic** correctly matches the folder name. Some apps store Start Menu entries under a different name.  

**Q: I see ‘⚠ Another uninstall job is already running. Please wait...’**  
✔️ The script prevents running multiple uninstall jobs simultaneously. Wait for the current process to finish before starting another.

**Q: WinGet commands fail on the remote machine.**  
✔️ Check if WinGet is installed (`winget --version`). If not, install it via:  
```powershell
Invoke-Command -ComputerName RemotePC -ScriptBlock { Get-AppxPackage -Name Microsoft.DesktopAppInstaller }
```
