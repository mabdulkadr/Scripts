.SYNOPSIS
    This script adds users from a CSV file to an Azure AD Security Group using the AzureAD PowerShell module.

.DESCRIPTION
    - Reads a list of users from a CSV file.
    - Checks if each user exists in Azure AD before adding them to the group.
    - Verifies if the user is already a member of the group to prevent duplicate additions.
    - Adds the user to the Azure AD security group if they are not already a member.
    - Uses error handling to log any issues encountered.
    - Includes a short delay between requests to avoid API rate-limiting.

.REQUIREMENTS
    - PowerShell
    - AzureAD Module (`Install-Module -Name AzureAD -Force`)
    - Admin privileges to manage Azure AD groups.

.PARAMETER CSVFilePath
    - The full path to the CSV file containing the list of users.
    - The CSV must have a header column named "UPN" with the users' email addresses.

.EXAMPLE
    - Run the script:
      ```powershell
      .\Add-AzureADUsersToGroup.ps1
      ```
    - Sample CSV file:
      ```
      UPN
      user1@domain.com
      user2@domain.com
      user3@domain.com
      ```
